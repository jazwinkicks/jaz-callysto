    "## A Crash Course in HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly scrape a page, you first need to know a little about HTML (also known as: hypertext markup language). It's what almost every website you'll find out there is built on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing that makes HTML different than regular text is its use of **tags**. A `<` marks the beginning of a tag and a `>` marks the end of a tag. If you're just using a single tag on its own, it should end with a `/>`. For example, a line break is `<br/>`. Your browser doesn't need to know anything else about it to know it should put an empty line between that tag and whatever comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most tags are a little more sophisticated than our rather boring `<br/>`. Most tags do *something* to what  comes after them. For example `<b>` tells you to start **making everything bold. But eventually bold words just get distracting, so you'll want to stop making them all bold. You do that with `</b>`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the only difference between the closing tag and the opening tag is that the closing tag begins with `</` instead of `<`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When your browser is figuring out how to display a page, it expects that you provide the closing tag whenever you use an opening tag. You can put whatever you want in between the opening and closing tag as long as it's valid HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `<i>foo</i>` will italicize *foo*. If you want to also make **<i>foo</i>** bold, you could put the valid HTML `<i>foo</i>` inside an opening and closing `b` tag: \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<b><i>foo</i></b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you're wondering, yes, you could also get the same result with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<i><b>foo</b></i>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That may seem like a lot of work to do something you could do in a couple of mouse clicks or key presses in your favourite word processor. The beauty of HTML is that all web browsers are expected to do the *same* thing when they run into any of the standard HTML tags. That means that the tags you wrote to make your text bold and italicized will result in **<i>bold, italicized</i>** text no matter what browser someone uses to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valid HTML Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned what basic valid HTML looks like. What about a whole HTML document? Here's the minimum an HTML document should have in order to be valid HTML5 (the latest version of HTML):\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n",
    "    <title>Your page title goes here.</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    Your main page content goes here.\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Web browsers can be pretty forgiving, and your page probably won't break if you miss some of these. Don't worry about trying to memorize this either. You can find it in more than enough places on line and it's perfectly okay to cut and paste to start out. Even the pros do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll just be focusing on what happens within the `<body></body>` tags, so for the following examples, just remember that to make them into a valid HTML document, you'd have to put them inside the `<body></body>` tags above."
