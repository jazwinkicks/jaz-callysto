    "Why on earth would you want to scrape a web page?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, you wouldn't have to. Everyone would realize that pages they put up on the web contained information that was useful beyond the ways they imagined, and while they built their web pages to present that information the way they wanted to, they'd *also* provide a way to get just that raw data in a way that is easy for machines to process. Things are getting better as everyone realizes the interesting things we can do with the raw data and all levels of government are making their data more open and accessible. But we're not quite there yet, and web scraping is often the necessary glue we need to use to stick things together while we wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we'll be able to grab the quotations from [Quotes to Scrape](http://quotes-to-scrape.com) and print them out directly, without all of the other information and formatting on the page that we don't want. We'll also be able to count up the number of quotes per author and display that information!\n",

    "## Ethical Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to think about what you're doing when you're scraping a website. You're collecting information that someone else or many people took a long time to gather. Your scraping code will also access information on their website much more quickly than a human would. This could cause problems for the website if you're not careful. This could result in your IP address being blocked by the website or more serious measures to stop you from hurting their quality of service. You should definitely check for any official notices the website may make discouraging scraping and respect them. Even if you don't see a notice, you should avoid scraping information simply to show exactly the same information on your own site. You should be doing something meaningful to that information and give credit and link to the source of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be careful about designing your scrapers. Don't leave scrapers running automatically that you're not sure are \"good web citizens\". Also, avoid running them too often. Do you really need to update things every few minutes? Or could you do it once a day? How about once a week? Or only when you rerun a cell in a notebook (like we're doing here)."

    "## A Crash Course in HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly scrape a page, you first need to know a little about HTML (also known as: hypertext markup language). It's what almost every website you'll find out there is built on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing that makes HTML different than regular text is its use of **tags**. A `<` marks the beginning of a tag and a `>` marks the end of a tag. If you're just using a single tag on its own, it should end with a `/>`. For example, a line break is `<br/>`. Your browser doesn't need to know anything else about it to know it should put an empty line between that tag and whatever comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most tags are a little more sophisticated than our rather boring `<br/>`. Most tags do *something* to what  comes after them. For example `<b>` tells you to start **making everything bold. But eventually bold words just get distracting, so you'll want to stop making them all bold. You do that with `</b>`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the only difference between the closing tag and the opening tag is that the closing tag begins with `</` instead of `<`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When your browser is figuring out how to display a page, it expects that you provide the closing tag whenever you use an opening tag. You can put whatever you want in between the opening and closing tags as long as it's valid HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `<i>foo</i>` will italicize *foo*. If you want to also make **<i>foo</i>** bold, you could put the valid HTML `<i>foo</i>` inside an opening and closing `b` tags: \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<b><i>foo</i></b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you're wondering, yes, you could also get the same result with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<i><b>foo</b></i>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That may seem like a lot of work to do something you could do in a couple of mouse clicks or key presses in your favourite word processor. The beauty of HTML is that all web browsers are expected to do the *same* thing when they run into any of the standard HTML tags. That means that the tags you wrote to make your text bold and italicized will result in **<i>bold, italicized</i>** text no matter what browser someone uses to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valid HTML Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned what basic valid HTML looks like. What about a whole HTML document? Here's the minimum an HTML document should have in order to be valid HTML5 (the latest version of HTML):\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n",
    "    <title>Your page title goes here.</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    Your main page content goes here.\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Web browsers can be pretty forgiving, and your page probably won't break if you miss some of these. Don't worry about trying to memorize this either. You can find it in more than enough places on line and it's perfectly okay to cut and paste to start out. Even the pros do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll just be focusing on what happens within the `<body></body>` tags, so for the following examples, just remember that to make them into a valid HTML document, you'd have to put them inside the `<body></body>` tags above."

But if we looked for every `<a></a>` tag, we'd get a bunch of links we didn't want. What parts of that heirarchy of elements really capture what the \"Next\" button is? Well, it's a navigation button, so it's not too unreasonable to expect that `nav` is likely to be a parent even if a lot of other things change. The `.next` class helps us tell between the \"Next\" and \"Previous\" buttons, so that's important too. We don't really care that it's on a list item (`<li></li>`) so we won't include that in the selector. And to get the `href` attribute, we need an `a` tag. By making sure that the `a` tag has a parent with `.next`, we can be fairly sure we're getting the right one. The creator of the page could certainly put multiple unrelated links under the `.next` parent, but the way the HTML is structured already suggests that they wouldn't be likely to do that.\n",

And you've learned how you can use information from `<a></a>` tags to navigate to other pages on a website. Finally, you've seen some of the questions you can answer through scraping that would be hard to answer otherwise. Congratulations!"
