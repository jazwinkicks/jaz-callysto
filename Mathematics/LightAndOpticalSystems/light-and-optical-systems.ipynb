    "In the diagram above, the yellow lines represent light rays. An object reflects light rays in lots of different directions. Some of the light is reflected towards the convex lens. When the light rays pass through the convex lens, they change direction. You can see how the light rays come together on the right side of the lens. This is the point where the *real image* is formed. It is called the **focal point**. Because of the way the lens changes the direction of the light rays, the *real image* on the right side of the lens is upside down. \n",

    "Let's try to understand this more completely, because the diagram only shows three light rays coming away from the object. In real life, there would be millions more (infinitely more, in fact) light rays coming off of the object. Let's say that the object was a car. All of the light rays that reflected off of the car's wheel would pass through the lens, get flipped upside down, and form a *real image* of the wheel on the other side of the lens. The same thing would happen to all parts of the car. \n",

    "Our eyes use real images formed by double convex lenses to see the world around us. Real images are formed in our eyes when light first passes through a transparent (see-through) layer called the *cornea*. This layer bends the light a little, but not very much. Next, the light passes through the *lens*, which bends the light rays far more than the cornea. The lens focuses light rays onto a layer of light receptor cells at the back of the eyeball called the *retina*. The retina converts the light energy into electrical signals which get sent down the *optic nerve* into the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at another person's eye, we see the colour of their eyes. The colored part is a muscle called the *iris*. A black circle in the middle of the iris is actually the hole that lets light through. This hole is called the *pupil*. When there is lots of light (like on a bright, sunny day), the iris **contracts**. This makes the pupil smaller so less light gets through. When there is not much light (like at night), the iris **dilates**. This makes the pupil get bigger so more light gets through. The iris is very important, since too much light getting through when it is very bright can damage your eyes.\n",
