## Adding fractions

 * What is a fraction?
 * Adding fractions
   * Like adding other things with units

There are two parts to a fraction: the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number).
An example of a fraction is 2/3.
There are many ways to read this fraction.
One way is to say "two over three".
Another way is to say "two thirds".



Adding fractions is easy, as long as we are adding fractions with the same denominator.
It is just like adding anything else.
We all know that two plus three equals five.
It is also true that two kilometers plus three kilometers equals five kilometers,
and that two teaspoons of sugar plus three teaspoons of sugar equals five teaspoons of sugar.
No matter what kind of thing we are adding, two of those things plus three more of those things equals five of those things.

The same idea works for fractions.
Two thirds plus three thirds equals five thirds, 2/3 + 3/3 = 5/3.
One fifth plus five fifths equals six fifths, 1/5 + 5/5 = 6/5.
This is easy to do as long as the denominators are the same.

**Exercises:**
  * One half plus one half.
  * Two thirds plus four thirds.
  * Six tenths plus seven tenths.
  * 1/2 + 2/2.
  * 2/4 + 3/4.
  * 4/6 + 9/6.



What if our denominators are different?
What is 1/2 + 1/4?
Now we are adding different kinds of "things": halves and quarters.

This is just like if we were to try to add two kilometers and three meters.
The answer is neither five kilometers nor five meters.
If we want to add two kilometers and three meters, we have to do a conversion.
2 kilometers is equal to 2000 meters,
so 2 kilometers plus 3 meters equals 2000 meters plus 3 meters, which equals 2003 meters.

We have to do a conversion when adding fractions with different denominators.
We have to change the fractions so that they both have the same denominator.
That way we are adding two of the same type of "thing".
In the case of 1/2 + 1/4, one half is equal to two quarters.
One half plus one quarter is the same as two quarters plus one quarter, which makes three quarters.

**Exercises:**
  * One half plus three quarters.
  * Two sixths plus two thirds.
  * 3/10 + 1/5.
  * 2/3 + 3/12.



In each of the exercises above, it was possible to rewrite one fraction so that it had the same denominator as the other fraction.
This is not always easy.
If we want to add 2/3 + 3/5, we cannot rewrite 2/3 as something over 5.
Nor can we rewrite 3/5 as something over 3.
(Actually, it is possible, but the numerator will not be a whole number!)
Instead, we have to rewrite both fractions.



## Lowest Common Denominator

What we want to do is rewrite our fractions so that they have the same denominator.
Here is one way to do it:
 * Write down a list of fractions that are equal to 2/3
 * Write down a list of fractions that are equal to 3/5
 * See if there is a fraction in each list with the same denominator.
So 2/3 is equal to
  2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 8/12 = 10/15 = 12/18 = ...
and 3/5 is equal to
  3/5 = 6/10 = 9/15 = 12/20 = 15/25 = 18/30 = ...

Both lists have a fraction whose denominator is 15.
So we can write 2/3 as 10/15 and write 3/5 as 9/15.
Then
  2/3 + 3/5 = 10/15 + 9/15 = 19/15

Here is another example.
Let's add 1/4 and 1/6.
Here is a list of fractions equal to 1/4
  1/4 = 2/8 = 3/12 = 4/16 = 5/20 = 6/24 = ...
and here is a list of fractions equal to 1/6
  1/6 = 2/12 = 3/18 = 4/24 = 5/30 = 6/36 = ...

Both lists have a fraction whose denominator is 12.
So we could write 1/4 as 3/12 and write 1/6 as 2/12 to get
  1/4 + 1/6 = 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12.
  
Both lists *also* have a fraction whose denominator is 24.
So it is also true that
  1/4 + 1/6 = 6/24 + 4/24 = 10/24.
If we made the first list even longer, then both lists would have a fraction over 36.

If we follow this method of rewriting fractions,
if we make each list long enough,
we will always find more than one choice of denominator (**Poorly worded**).
There are infinitely many choices!
But there is always one choice that is smaller than all the others.
This is the **lowest common denominator**.
