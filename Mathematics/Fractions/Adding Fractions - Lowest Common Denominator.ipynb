    "Now what do we do when we are asked to add two fractions,\n",

    "The simplest example of this is adding $\\frac 1 2 + \\frac 1 3$.\n",
    "3 is not a multiple of 2, nor is 2 a multiple of 3.\n",
    "We cannot rewrite 1/2 as something over 3,\n",
    "nor can we rewrite 1/3 as something over 2.\n",
    "(Actually, it is possible, but the numerator will not be a whole number!)\n",
    "Instead, we have to rewrite both fractions!\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to do this is to multiply the top and bottom of each fraction by the denominator of the other.\n",
    "For example, we are trying to add $\\frac 1 2 + \\frac 1 3$.\n",
    "So we multiply the top and bottom of $\\frac 1 2$ by 3, the denominator of $\\frac 1 3$.\n",
    "Then we multiply the top and bottom of $\\frac 1 3$ by 2, the denominator of $\\frac 1 2$.\n",
    "If we do that, then both fractions will have the same denominator, 6, so we can add them:\n",
    "$$ \\frac 1 2 + \\frac 1 3 = \\frac {1 \\times 3} {2 \\times 3} + \\frac {1 \\times 2} {3 \\times 2} = \\frac 3 6 + \\frac 2 6 = \\frac 5 6. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This works no matter what the denominators are.\n",
    "Here is another example.\n",
    "Let's add $\\frac 3 4 + \\frac 5 6$.\n",
    "We multiply the top and bottom of each fraction by the bottom of the other fraction.\n",
    "So we multiply the top and bottom of $\\frac 3 4$ by 6 and the top and bottom of $\\frac 5 6$ by 4.\n",
    "$$ \\frac 3 4 + \\frac 5 6 = \\frac {3 \\times 6} {4 \\times 6} + \\frac {5 \\times 4} {6 \\times 4} = \\frac {18} {24} + \\frac {20} {24} = \\frac {38} {24}.$$ "
