    ">## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A radical equation is an equation in which a variable is under a radical. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, this is a radical equation, because the variable is inside the square root:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} -5= 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following is not a radical equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{2} -x= 3,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "because there is no variable inside the radical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will learn the strategy to solve  **radical equations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind the strategy is that we can \"get rid\" of a square root by raising the radical to the power of two. It follows, that when you want to solve an equation with containing a radical expression you have to isolate the radical on one side from all other terms and then square both sides of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3\\sqrt{x} = 9.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to isolate the radical expression. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives you\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we square both sides to eliminate the square root\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^2 = (3)^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when solving radical equations things are not always this easy. Throughout this notebook, we will learn how to deal with more complicated cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start solving equations, we must keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Square sides, not terms\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that when we are solving a radical equation we want to eliminate the square root. We can do that by raising it to the power of two.\n",
    "When solving an equation, we must apply the same operation to both SIDES of the equation; in particular, we don't do things to each term in the equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a radical equation, we must square both sides; we should never try to square every term. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3+4 =7$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above is obviously a true statement. If I square both sides \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(3+4)^2 =7^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I end up with with a correct statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$49=49.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if I square term by term\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3^2+4^2=7^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I end up with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$25=49,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is obviously not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common mistakes when  solving radical equations is trying to square terms. Always square sides, not terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Check Your Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can always check our solution to an equation by plugging the solution back into the original equation and making sure that it results into a true statement. For instance,  $x + 2 = 5$ has obviously solution $x = 3$. We can confirm this solution by plugging it back into the original equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x + 2 = (3) + 2 = 5.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with solving radical equations is that we may do every step correctly, but still end up with a wrong answer. This is because the very act of squaring the sides can create solutions that never existed before. These kind of solutions are called **extraneous**. We will learn more about them later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, remember to always check your answers when solving a radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine any restrictions on values for the variable in a radical equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we need to pay attention to when solving radical equations is determining which value of  the solution are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, as long as we are working with real numbers, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. Thus, we must be careful to ensure that we do not choose values for a variable that would result in taking the square root of a negative number. To avoid this situation, we must restric the set of values the variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will differentiate between different cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radical Expressions that Contain a Single Term Radicand**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest case\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know that in this case, the solution is restricted to have any positive value, *including $0$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose though, that our equation has more complicated radicands in it. What's the strategy in those cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the general idea to follow is that we want  the entire expression under the root sign not to  be equal to a negative number. That is, it must equal zero or any other positive value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if we have an equation $\\sqrt{17x} = 6$, we must set the expression under the square root to be greater or equal than zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$17x\\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolating for $x$ gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $x$ in the radical equation can take any positive number greater or equal than zero. Of course we still need to solve the equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{17x} = 6 \\to 17x = 36 \\to x=\\frac{36}{17}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the solution $\\frac{36}{17}$ is greater than zero, then we can admit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the following equation $\\sqrt{x -4} = 5$. Again, we need to set the expression under the square root to be greater or equal than zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x-4\\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolating for $x$ gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 4.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $x$ in the radical equation can take any positive number greater or equal than 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we solve the radical equation. The radicand is already isolated so we can square both sides right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\sqrt{x -4}\\right) = (5)^2 \\to x-4 = 25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 29,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is again a acceptable value because $29> 4$.\n",
