    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A radical equation is an equation in which a variable is under a radical. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, this is a radical equation, because the variable is inside the square root:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} -5= 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following is not a radical equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{2} -x= 3,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "because there is no variable inside the radical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will learn the strategy to solve  **radical equations** focusing only on radicals which are square roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind the strategy is that we can \"get rid\" of a square root by raising the radical to the power of two.\n",
    "We can solve an equation that contains a radical expression by isolating the radical on one side of the equation, then square both sides of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3\\sqrt{x} = 9.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to isolate the radical expression. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives us\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x} = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we square both sides to eliminate the square root\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)^2 = (3)^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when solving radical equations things are not always this easy. Throughout this notebook, we will learn how to deal with more complicated cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start solving equations, we must keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Square sides, not terms\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that when we are solving a radical equation we want to eliminate the square root. We can do that by raising it to the power of two.\n",
    "When solving an equation, we must apply the same operation to both SIDES of the equation; in particular, we can't do things to each term in the equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a radical equation, we must square both sides; we should never try to square every term. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3+4 =7$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above is obviously a true statement. If we square both sides \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(3+4)^2 =7^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we end up with a correct statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$49=49.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we square term by term\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3^2+4^2=7^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we end up with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$25=49,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is obviously not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common mistakes when  solving radical equations is trying to square terms. **Always square sides, not terms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Check Your Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can always check our solution to an equation by plugging the solution back in the original equation and making sure that it results into a true statement. For example,  $x + 2 = 5$ obviously has the solution $x = 3$. We can confirm this solution by plugging it back into the original equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x + 2 &= 5\\\\\n",
    "(3) + 2 &= 5\\\\\n",
    "5 &=5\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty that arises when solving radical equations is that we may perform every step correctly, but still end up with an incorrect answer. This is because the very act of squaring both sides can create solutions that never existed before. These kind of solutions are called **extraneous**. We will learn more about them later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, remember to always check your answers when solving a radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine the restrictions on  the variable in a radical equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we need to pay attention to when solving radical equations is determining which values of  the solution are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, as long as we are working with real numbers, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. Thus, we must be careful to ensure that we do not choose values for a variable that would result in taking the square root of a negative number. To avoid this situation, we must restrict the set of values the variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radical Expressions that Contain a Single Term Radicand**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest case\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know that in this case, the variable $x$ is restricted to have only nonnegative value. Remember that $0$ is  *included* in this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose though, that our equation has more complicated radicands in it. What's the strategy in those cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the general idea to follow is that the expression under the root sign cannot be negative. That is, it must equal zero or any other positive value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if we have the equation $\\sqrt{17x} = 6$, we must set the expression under the square root to be greater than or equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$17x\\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $x$ in the radical equation can only take on values greater than or equal to zero. Of course, we still need to solve the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\sqrt{17x} &= 6\\\\\n",
    "17x &= 36\\\\ \n",
    "x&=\\frac{36}{17}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the solution $\\frac{36}{17}$ is greater than or equal to zero, it satisfies our restraint, and is considered a valid solution to the radical equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the equation $\\sqrt{x -4} = 5$. Again, we need to set the expression under the square root to be greater than or equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x-4\\geq 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $x$ gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\geq 4.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $x$ in the radical equation can take any positive number greater than or equal to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we solve the radical equation. The radicand is already isolated so we can square both sides right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\left(\\sqrt{x -4}\\right)^2 &= (5)^2\\\\\n",
